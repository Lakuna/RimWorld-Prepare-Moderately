	<description>This mod is intended as a balanced replacement for EdB Prepare Carefully. Allows the player to set minimum specifications for colonists; colonists that do not meet these specifications are automatically re-rolled. Never again will you have to roll through hundreds of colonists looking for a cannibal psychopath.</description>
